After picking a layout and color scheme based off of the examples available on Wordpress, we decided to use the following colors as a scheme for design.
- Primary: #42a1cc
- Secondary: #2d85b0
- Highlight: # ff6d4a


We decided to go with a board game site and knew that the various pages would have different functionality, so layout of the header and footer would be the only consistent pieces. We would have to rely on the color scheme as a unifying design element.

We broke the pages up and scope our elements carefully to avoid merge conflicts. Now that the basic layout of the site is complete a refactoring of the CSS is probably in order.

There were suggestions for improved functionality and other ideas that could be implemented with Javascript. However, these might be saved for a future date and project.
